 The code enables you to create a eclipse of any kind with the help of "turtle Library". You can decide the center, the size, where to start, how it is skewed and how long the arc is. The only thing you need to do is to copy the function to your project and emter the proper parameters. The positions of different parameters can be seen in the notes in the eclipse.py.

本代码可以用来在turtle库下绘制各种各样的椭圆。可变的参数有：中点、大小（长短轴），起画点，倾斜度，弧长。详见代码中的注释。
